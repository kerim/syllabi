## Participation
Reading for this class has been kept to a minimum so as to give students more time to focus on the hands-on experience of making ethnographic films. However, there is still some required reading, most of which is available in Chinese. All students are expected to do all of the reading and to come to class ready to discuss the reading. 

## Home Work
Students will complete three shorter homework assignments to learn different styles of filmmaking. There will be an "observational" film which records naturally occurring human behavior without commentary. There will be an "interview" assignment which consists entirely of interviews in different settings (such as sitting down indoors, or walking around outdoors). And there will be a "reflexive" assignment which uses "found footage" (supplied by the instructor) to make a short video essay. Students will be provided with handouts and explanations for these assignments over the course of the semester. Each of these pieces will be approximately five minutes long and will be shared and discussed in class.

## Final project
Treat this project as you would a research paper. Unlike a research paper, however, it is not possible to make up for lost time at the end of the semester. To help students with planning, this project has been broken down into a series of smaller assignments with deadlines throughout the semester. These will include things like writing up a topic statement, completing principle shooting, writing up shooting logs and transcripts, etc. See the course outline for the exact due dates for each of these assignments. Students will be provided with hand outs and explanations for each of these assignments over the course of the semester. The final project should be under fifteen minutes in length.
