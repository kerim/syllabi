## 課堂參與

這門課的閱讀量已經盡可能保持少量，為了讓同學們有更多時間聚焦在動手製作民族誌影片的部分。然而，還是有一些指定閱讀，大部分都有中文版可以看。我期望全部的同學在上課前就完成閱讀。

Reading for this class has been kept to a minimum so as to give students more time to focus on the hands-on experience of making ethnographic films. However, there is still some required reading, most of which is available in Chinese. All students are expected to do all of the reading and to come to class ready to discuss the reading. 

## 平時作業

同學們將會完成三份小的指定作業，是有關於影片製作的不同風格。觀察式影片作業要自然記錄人類行為，而沒有留下評論；訪談式影片作業則包含不同狀況下的全部訪談（譬如室內坐下來談，或是到戶外邊走邊談）。也會有反身式影片的作業需要製作一份短的影像論文，這份作業會使用由我提供的拾得錄像（found footage）。到時候會提供同學們這些作業的講義和說明。每一份作業的影片維持在大約五分鐘的長度，成品將會在課堂上與大家分享並討論。

Students will complete three shorter homework assignments to learn different styles of filmmaking. There will be an "observational" film which records naturally occurring human behavior without commentary. There will be an "interview" assignment which consists entirely of interviews in different settings (such as sitting down indoors, or walking around outdoors). And there will be a "reflexive" assignment which uses "found footage" (supplied by the instructor) to make a short video essay. Students will be provided with handouts and explanations for these assignments over the course of the semester. Each of these pieces will be approximately five minutes long and will be shared and discussed in class.

## 期末專題

請對待這份專題如一份研究報告。然而，不像研究報告，你不太可能在學期末時補足進度。為了幫助同學們規劃專題進度，我已經將專題拆成一整學期裡一連串的小作業。這些作業包含撰寫主題敘述、完成原則拍攝（principle shooting）、撰寫拍攝日誌以及謄寫拍攝內容等等。詳細的時程請見課程流程。到時候我會提供同學每一個環節作業的說明與講義，期末專題以不超過十五分鐘為準。 

Treat this project as you would a research paper. Unlike a research paper, however, it is not possible to make up for lost time at the end of the semester. To help students with planning, this project has been broken down into a series of smaller assignments with deadlines throughout the semester. These will include things like writing up a topic statement, completing principle shooting, writing up shooting logs and transcripts, etc. See the course outline for the exact due dates for each of these assignments. Students will be provided with hand outs and explanations for each of these assignments over the course of the semester. The final project should be under fifteen minutes in length.
