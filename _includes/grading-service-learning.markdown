## 教學方法
In service learning, service and learning are equally important. For this reason it is not enough to simply complete the minimum 12 hours of service required by the program. Students must also engage in “critical reflection” before, during, and after they engage in this service. For that reason class participation, blogs, and the final report are an essential part of the the class. During the semester a number of assignments will be handed out to help facilitate this process. Students are encouraged to work together as groups, but students who wish to work on their own may do so as well. Attendance during all class sessions is mandatory. Because there are so few sessions held in the classroom, and because discussion is so important to this class, students who miss more than two required sessions without a doctor’s note run the risk of failing the class. Because class is held during lunch time, students are welcome to eat in class.
