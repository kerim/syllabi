## 教學方法
This is a seminar style class. Students are all expected to do the weekly readings every week. In addition, there will be in-class presentations on the readings which will be assigned each week. The exact number of presentations required will depend on class enrollment. Because the readings require a knowledge of films as well as texts, there will also be two to three films assigned each week. Students are encouraged to schedule a time to watch these films together, but it is not required and a copy of the films will be left in the office for those students who wish to borrow them for home viewing. Watching these films is not optional as each week's readings are paired to the films assigned for that week and viewing them is necessary in order to follow the discussion. The assignments will be in the form of two "visual essays" with the details of what is required to be handed out during the second week of class. A short visual essay on an individual scene will be presented in class during midterms, and a longer visual essay on a documentary film or director will be presented during the last two weeks of class.
