### Teaching Method
* After the first day of class students will be divided into groups. Each group will be responsible for the readings on the weeks assigned in the course outline (see attached). On those days, each member of group will be responsible for individually analyzing the readings according to the method described below. These assignments must be posted to the online discussion group before midnight on the day before class, and a hard copy should be given to the TA when you come to class. Group members should also be prepared to be called upon individually to discuss the reading in class. There will also be a midterm and final exams, both oral.. Classroom and online participation will be an important part of the course and will count towards final grades.

## Grading and Assignments

### Analysis
* The reading analysis should be between 800 and 1600 characters of original writing (i.e. not including quoted material and citations).
* All analysis should follow the same format:
 1. What questions are posed by the author?
 2. What is the data and methodology used by the author to answer her questions?
 3. List the main points argued by the author in answering this question. (Usually 2-5 points, depending on the article.)
 4. For each point, provide one example from another book/film/news story, or from your own experience, illustrating the author's point. Your example must match the intentions of the author in the article. (Be sure to cite your sources.)
 5. End with some questions for the author. Be specific. Are there counter-arguments you wish she had considered? Is there something wrong with the author's methodology? Or do you wish she had looked at some other kinds of data

### Report 
* While the reading analysis is an individual assignment, the presentation is a group assignment. Everyone in the group must participate in the presentation. Students must prepare lecture notes for the presentation (i.e. do not read directly from the book or from your reading analysis but write a presentation lecture).
* You must prepare a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation as well. The PPT should not be the same as your lecture notes, but must highlight only the main points. At the end of your presentation, please present some questions for general discussion. Each group will have 20 min to present. On average, you should spend no longer than 30sec. on each Power Point slide, so for a 20 min presentation you will want at least 40 slides.
* You will be asked to hand in your PPT and lecture notes.

### Oral Exams 
* Students should treat oral exams as seriously as they do written ones. Students are expected to review the course materials before the exam.
* Oral exames will include topics discussed in class, online discussions, student reports, etc. not only the assigned readings, so students should take good notes in class and review them before the exam.

### Grading System 
* "E" – You are a ghost. I either didn't see you all semester, or maybe you have been sent to hell for cheating?
* "D" – You are a zombie. I see your body in class, but your brain is somewhere else.
* "C" – Soldier. You do what you are told. No more, no less.
* "B" – Scholar. You are enthusiastic about learning new ideas, but maybe you were daydreaming too much to get an "A"?
* "A" – Hero. You not only combine the qualities of the soldier and the scholar, not only fulfilling the course requirements but also going beyond them in your pursuit of knowledge.

## Participation 
* Actively participating in class discussion and online will also help your overall score. Don't worry if I disagree with what you say. I prefer students to express strong opinions, even if they are different from my own. I may sound "harsh" if I argue with you in class, but you can be sure that if you stick up for your own ideas you will get a better grade, not a worse one!!!

## Questions
* If in doubt, ask! I have regular office hours, an e-mail list for the class, and my private e-mail address. There is no excuse for not knowing what is expected of you.
