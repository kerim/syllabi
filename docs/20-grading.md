### 評分標準
* What my grades mean:
* "E" –妳/你就像鬼魂一樣。我甚至整個學期都沒看過妳/你，或是也許妳/你已被騙到地獄了？
* "D" –妳/你就像個殭屍。我看到妳/你的肉體在教室內，但是妳/你的思緒在其他地方。
* "C" –士兵。妳/你做了應該做的。不多也不少。
* "B" –學者。妳/你很狂熱的學習新知識，但是要得到"A"還要再更努力，而非像做白日夢一樣。
* "A" –英雄。妳/你不只是結合士兵與學者的品質，還完成本課程的要求，更是已經超越了所追求的知識。
* "E" - You are a ghost. I either didn't see you all semester, or maybe you have been sent to hell for cheating?
* "D" - You are a zombie. I see your body in class, but your brain is somewhere else.
* "C" - Soldier. You do what you are told. No more, no less.
* "B" - Scholar. You are enthusiastic about learning new ideas, but maybe you were daydreaming too much to get an "A"?
* "A" - Hero. You not only combine the qualities of the soldier and the scholar, not only fulfilling the course requirements but also going beyond them in your pursuit of knowledge.
