## 什麼是抄襲？
* 就是發表別人的作品或是想法時，好像是自己原創的。不管抄襲多寡，只要抄襲妳/你就會被當掉! (請參考這個網址,和Chicago 格式簡要範例 學習如何正確地引用參考書目)
* It is presenting other people's work or ideas as if it were your own. It doesn't matter how much or how little you do this - if you do it you will be failed! (See the handout on plagiarism, for an explanation, and the Chicago 格式簡要範例to learn how to properly cite references.)
