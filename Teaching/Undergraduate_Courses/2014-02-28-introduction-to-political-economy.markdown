本課程關注於經濟人類學、發展研究、社會史、性別研究，用以探討三個重疊的問題：文化與經濟間的連結為何？殖民主義對原住民的影響為何？現代全球化經濟體系如何影響全世界的原初家庭？不管什麼時候，都需要在這些議題中運用個案研究，以促進課堂討論。This course draws on economic anthropology, development studies, social history, and gender studies in order to explore three overlapping sets of questions: What is the link between culture and the economy? What was the impact of colonialism upon indigenous peoples? And how has the modern global economic system affected ordinary families around the world? Wherever possible, individual case studies are used in order to bring these issues to life and to promote in-class discussion.
