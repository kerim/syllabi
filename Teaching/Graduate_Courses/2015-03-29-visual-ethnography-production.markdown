This is a nuts and bolts course, which assumes that students already have a theoretical grounding in film analysis and the theory of ethnographic and documentary film and photography. Emphasis will not be on learning specific tools (although we will do that as well), but on learning the underlying concepts of digital video production and nonlinear editing so that students will be able to adapt to rapidly changing technology. Special attention will be paid to the theory and practice of video editing.
