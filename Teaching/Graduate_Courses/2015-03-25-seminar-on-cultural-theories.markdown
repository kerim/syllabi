Required theory course for Ph.D. students. 博士班學生必修.

This class seeks, in a single semester, to give Ph.D. students a thorough grounding in the foundations of contemporary cultural theory. Topics include classical political economy (Marx, Weber, Durkheim), Structuralism and Post-Structuralism (Levi-Strauss, Foucault, and Bourdieu), Gender and Sexuality, Theories of Knowledge (including discussions of the ethnographic method), as well as Globalization Theory and Nationalism. The primary goal of this fast-paced course is to lay a groundwork for further study. For this reason, particular attention will be paid to the intellectual context from which each of these works emerged. A secondary goal of the course is to develop critical reading skills. Through close readings of primary texts students will be encouraged to engage in internal critique, evaluating the texts in their own terms. Student evaluation will be based on weekly in-class presentations, an online reading journal (blog), and two formal debates to be held at midterm and finals. Auditors are welcome, but they must participate in all class activities, including presentations, reading journals, and debates.

這一學期課程內容為博士班學生在文化理論方面的概念基礎。議題包括：古典政治經濟學（馬克思、韋伯、涂爾幹）、結構主義與後結構主義（李維斯陀、傅柯、布狄厄）、性別與性欲特質、知識論（包括民族誌方法的討論），以及全球化理論與民族主義。課程目標在於為學生提供未來研究基礎，因此首要目標著重於探討理論緣起背景，第二讓學生發展批判技巧。透過課堂閱讀教材，學生被鼓勵發展內在批判能力，以對閱讀教材進行批判。對學生的評鑑是以每周課堂表現、blog，以及期中、期末的正式辯論。本課程接受旁聽，但是旁聽生需要參與課堂活動，包括：課堂表現、閱讀教材與辯論。
