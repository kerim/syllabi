notes: "Graduate seminar on production methods in visual anthropology."

This course is teaches students ethnographic research methods using a hands-on approach. In addition to making their own short ethnographic films, the course will address many issues which apply as much to written ethnographies as they do to visual ones, including: research ethics, collaborative research methods, interviewing technique, transcription, and the art of participant observation. 

This course seeks to move beyond traditional journalistic approaches commonly used in TV documentaries in order to learn techniques better suited for the complex needs of ethnographic research. In particular, students will learn about "observational," "participatory," and "reflexive" styles of filmmaking. By the end of the course students should be able to mix and match these different styles according to their own needs.

Although this course will cover those technical aspects of filmmaking which are absolutely essential for new filmmakers to learn, it is not a technical course. Modern day video technology and editing software has become sophisticated and ubiquitous enough that most students no longer need extensive training to use these tools. The technical aspect of the course will focus instead the principles of video editing as these principles are rarely taught in school and remain useful regardless of the specific tools being used. 

Students are encouraged to use their own equipment if they have any. There is also professional grade equipment available in the department’s own media lab should students wish to borrow it. No previous experience in video production is required for this class.
