Prospective Advisees

* Before you approach me, please prepare a concise statement of your research interests. This statement must have a clear thesis statement, an argument (see my [study guides page][study-guides]), and a discussion of your research methodology.
* I take advising and sitting on committees seriously. For this reason I cannot accept students who come to me so late that it will be impossible for them to make revisions based on my advice and feedback.

* Read this advice for those [considering graduate school][grad-students].
